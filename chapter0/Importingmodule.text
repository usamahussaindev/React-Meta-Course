notes>

there are several ways to import javascript modules just like exporting

Consider importing the same modules  we export in previous notes

now importing it 

"addTwo function"

fucntion addTwo(a + b){
    console.log( a + b);

}

export deault addTwo;

now import:

import adddTwo from "./addTwo" in this new add.js file;

//rest code goes here and also can use import code fucntionaliity


//now this way we can use diffferent modules in different areas of code
